# bibliotheque

This is a simple book tracking app where you can add and remove books into a library. You can also change the book status (read/unread), see basic information about your books and keep your progress in each book.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s [JavaScript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum.
